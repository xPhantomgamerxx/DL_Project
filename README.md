# Face embedding trainer

This repository contains the framework for training deep embeddings for face recognition. The trainer is intended for the face recognition exercise of the EE488 Deep Learning for Visual Understanding course.

### Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training examples

- Softmax:
```
python ./trainEmbedNet.py --model ResNet18 --trainfunc softmax --save_path exps/exp1 --nClasses 2000 --batch_size 200 --gpu 8
```

GPU ID must be specified using `--gpu` flag.

Use `--mixedprec` flag to enable mixed precision training. This is recommended for Tesla V100, GeForce RTX 20 series or later models.

### Implemented loss functions
```
Softmax (softmax)
Triplet (triplet)
```

For softmax-based losses, `nPerClass` should be 1, and `nClasses` must be specified. For metric-based losses, `nPerClass` should be 2 or more. 

### Implemented models
```
ResNet18
```

### Adding new models and loss functions

You can add new models and loss functions to `models` and `loss` directories respectively. See the existing definitions for examples.

### Data

The test list should contain labels and image pairs, one line per pair, as follows. `1` is a target and `0` is an imposter.
```
1,id10001/00001.jpg,id10001/00002.jpg
0,id10001/00003.jpg,id10002/00001.jpg
```

The folders in the training set should contain images for each identity (i.e. `identity/image.jpg`).

The input transformations can be changed in the code.

### Inference

In order to save pairwise similarity scores to file, use `--output` flag.
